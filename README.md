Features
1. Users can query for a restaurant based on their location, and sort it by best match, highest rated, and most reviewed.
2. Users can view a list of businesses that match their query, sorted by best match, highest rated, or most reviews.
3. Users can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation.
